- KMComposer cannot set the subject. Seems to be a problem in kmmessage.cpp
  cause KMMessage::setSubject(const char *aStr) gets the subject string 
  without any problem but does use it correctly.
- Pop does not append downloaded msgs to according folder
- Set your pop passwd manually in kmacctpop.cpp
- Config stuff missing. Copy this kmailrc to your ~/.kde/config/
- Saving of octet-streams does not work ( something goes wrong decoding)
- mimemagic stuff does not look at the extension yet only scans file content.
  Result is that some files are not recognized correctly
- Attaching bodyParts is not yet possible. Something must be wrong with
  addBodyPart() or I am just too stupid.
