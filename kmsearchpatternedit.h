/** A widget to edit a single KMSearchRule.
    It consists of an editable QComboBox for the field,
    a read-only QComboBox for the function and
    a QLineEdit for the content or the pattern (in case of regexps).
    It manages the i18n itself, so field name should be in it's english form.

    To use, you essentially give it the reference to a KMSearchRule and
    it does the rest. It will never delete the rule itself, as it assumes
    that something outside of it manages this.

/** This widget is intended to be used in the filter configuration as
    well as in the message search dialogs. It consists of a frame,
    inside which there are placed two radio buttons entitled "Match
    {all,any} of the following", followed by a vertical stack of
    KMSearchRuleWidgets (initially two) and two buttons to add and
    remove, resp., additional KMSearchWidget 's.

    To set the widget according to a given KMSearchPattern, use
    setSearchPattern; to initialize it (e.g. for a new, virgin
    rule), use setSearchPattern with a 0 argument. The widget
    operates directly on a shallow(!) copy of the search rule. So
    while you actually don't really need searchPattern, because
    you can always store a pointer to the current pattern yourself,
    you must not modify the currently-worked-on pattern yourself while
    this widget holds a reference to it. The only exceptions are:

    @li If you edit a derived class, you can change aspects of the
    class that don't interfere with the KMSearchPattern part. An
    example is KMFilter, whose actions you can still edit while
    the KMSearchPattern part of it is being acted upon by this
    widget.

    @li You can change the name of the pattern, but only using (this
    widget's) setName. You cannot change the pattern's name
    directly, although this widget in itself doesn't let the user
    change it. This is because it auto-names the pattern to
    "<$field>:$contents" iff the pattern begins with "<".

    @short A widget which allows editing a set of KMSearchRule's.
