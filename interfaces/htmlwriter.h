   *
   * @deprecated KMail should be ported to Interface::HtmlWriter. This
   * interface exposes internal working models. The queueing
   * vs. writing() issues exposed here should be hidden by using two
   * different implementations of KHTMLPartHtmlWriter: one for
   * queueing, and one for writing. This should be fixed before the
   * release, so we an keep the plugin interface stable.
   *
   * Operate this interface in one and only one of the following two
   * modes:
   *
   * @section Sync Mode
   *
   * In sync mode, use #begin() to initiate a session, then 
   * #write() some chunks of HTML code and finally #end() the session.
   *
   * @section Async Mode
   *
   * In async mode, use #begin() to initialize a session, then
   * #queue() some chunks of HTML code and finally end the
   * session by calling #flush().
   *
   * Queued HTML code is fed to the html sink using a timer. For this
   * to work, control must return to the event loop so timer events
   * are delivered.
   *
   * @section Combined mode
   *
   * You may combine the two modes in the following way only. Any
   * number of #write() calls can precede #queue() calls,
   * but once a chunk has been queued, you @em must @em not
   * #write() more data, only #queue() it.
   *
   * Naturally, whenever you queued data in a given session, that
   * session must be ended by calling #flush(), not #end().
