     * @short An interface to body part reader link handlers
     * @author Marc Mutz <mutz@kde.org>
     *
     * This interface is a condensed of variant of the more general
     * @see URLHandler interface, designed to make bodypart-dependent
     * link operations possible without exposing KMail-internal
     * classes.
     *
     * Implementation-wise, these handlers are called as a nested
     * Chain Of Responsibilty by an internal implementation of
     * URLHandler.
     *
     * You can create a link whose handling is passed to this handler
     * by using BodyPart::makeLink( const QString & path ). \a path is
     * what * is passed back to the methods of this interface.
     *
     * Note that the BodyPart interface does not provide a means of
     * learning the content type of the body part passed. This is
     * intentional. It is expected that either separate
     * BodyPartURLHandlers are created for these purposes or else the
     * information encoded into the path parameter by the
     * BodyPartFormatter.
