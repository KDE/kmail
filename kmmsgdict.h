/**
 * @short KMail message dictionary. Keeps location information for every
 * message. The message serial number is the key for the dictionary.
 *
 * The KMMsgDict singleton is used to look up at which index in which folder a
 * certain serial number can be found. Each folder holds a "reverse entry",
 * which is an array of message dict entries for that folder and persists that
 * to disk as an array of serial numbers, the "$folder.index.ids" file.
 * In effect the whole message dict is therefor persisted per folder
 * and restored on startup when all folder dict entries are read and re-enter
 * their respective entries (serial numbers) into the global dict. The code for
 * creating, deleting and manipulating these files is in this class, rather than
 * the FolderStorage class, which only holds the pointer to the reverse entry
 * and otherwise knows nothing of the message dict.
