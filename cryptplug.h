    \brief Common API header for CRYPTPLUG.

    CRYPTPLUG is an independent cryptography plug-in API
    developed for Sphinx-enabeling KMail and Mutt.

    CRYPTPLUG was designed for the Aegypten project, but it may
    be used by 3rd party developers as well to design pluggable
    crypto backends for the above mentioned MUAs.

    \note All string parameters appearing in this API are to be
    interpreted as UTF-8 encoded.

    \see pgpplugin.c
    \see gpgplugin.c

/*! \defgroup groupGeneral Loading and Unloading the Plugin, General Functionality

    The functions in this section are used for loading and
    unloading plugins. Note that the actual locating of the plugin
    and the loading and unloading of the dynamic library is not
    covered here; this is MUA-specific code for which support code
    might already exist in the programming environments.
*/

/*! \defgroup groupDisplay Graphical Display Functionality

    The functions in this section return stationery that the
    MUAs can use in order to display security functionality
    graphically. This can be toolbar icons, shortcuts, tooltips,
    etc. Not all MUAs will use all this functionality.
*/

/*! \defgroup groupConfig Configuration Support

    The functions in this section provide the necessary
    functionality to configure the security functionality as well
    as to query configuration settings. Since all configuration
    settings will not be saved with the plugin, but rather with
    the MUA, there are also functions to set configuration
    settings programmatically; these will be used on startup of
    the plugin when the MUA transfers the configuration values it
    has read into the plugin. Usually, the functions to query and
    set the configuration values are not needed for anything but
    saving to and restoring from configuration files.

    The functions in this section provide the functionality

    \note Whenever the term <b> encryption</b> is used here,
    it is supposed to mean both encryption and decryption,
