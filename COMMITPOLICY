to the KMail decision making process, as was decided on the kde-core 
development list and is reflected by the state of the KMail about 
box.

The KMail decision making group consists of all KMail core developers, 
including maintainers. The decision making process is as follows:

In the result of a conflict over a commit to the KMail section of KDE 
CVS a resolution to this conflict, that is the decision to keep or 
revert the commit can be decided by a unanimous agreement of the 
maintainers, or failing that a resolution to the conflict will be 
decided by a vote of KMail core developers.
