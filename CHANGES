>>>>>>> 1.2

* drag&drop: the file kmdragdata.h describes the structure that
  is used for dragging.
  Dragging messages to anywhere outside kmail is not possible (at the moment).

* the delete button works, others will follow.

* alarm timer class: a timer that works also when the application is
  busy (Qt's implementation does not).

* animated busy pointer :-)))
  I have perverted the "forward message" button: press to toggle
  the busy pointer.
  This is code I have written some time ago and converted now for Kde.
  Tell me if you like it.
