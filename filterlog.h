    @short KMail Filter Log Collector.
    @author Andreas Gungl <a.gungl@gmx.de>

    The filter log helps to collect log information about the
    filter process in KMail. It's implemented as singleton,
    so it's easy to direct pieces of information to a unique
    instance.
    It's possible to activate / deactivate logging. All
    collected log information can get thrown away, the
    next added log entry is the first one until another 
    clearing.
    A signal is emitted whenever a new logentry is added,
    when the log was cleared or any log state was changed.
