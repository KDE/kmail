<title>Using &kmail;</title>

<sect1 id="the-mail-reader-window">
<title>The Main Window</title>

<para>The main window is the window that appears
when &kmail; is started. It is by default divided into three panes:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Folder list (on the left)</term>
<listitem>
  <screenshot>
<screeninfo>Folder Pane</screeninfo>
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="folder-example.png" format="PNG"/>

      <phrase>Folder Pane</phrase>
    </textobject>
    <caption>
      <para>Folder Pane</para>
    </caption>
  </mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>This pane contains the list of your message folders (other email programs
may call them mailboxes). To select a folder, simply click on
it. The messages contained in the folder will now appear in the Headers
pane. The folder list can be displayed in both a short view, which takes up only
a small portion of the left side of the screen, and a long view, which takes up the 
entire left side of the screen but is able to show more mailboxes. You can toggle
between these two views under <guilabel>Appearance</guilabel>/<guilabel>Layout</guilabel>
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
&kmail;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialog. The top section of the folder pane contains quick links
to your favorite folders. Add folders here through the &RMB; context menu <guimenuitem>Add to Favorite Folders</guimenuitem>.
Please see the <link linkend="folders">Folders Section</link> for detailed information about how to use folders.</para>

<para>This pane lists header information (message Status Flags, Sender, Subject,
Date, and other optional columns like Size, Attachment Flag, Important Flag, etc.)
for the messages in the currently selected folder. Clicking on a header
will select that message and display it in the Message pane; you can also select
more than one message by holding down the &Ctrl; key when clicking on messages.
Change the view of your message list by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Message List</guimenuitem>
<guimenuitem>Theme</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You have several options here.
</para>
<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para><guilabel>Smart</guilabel> A smart multi-line, multi-item with status icons, no sort columns.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><guilabel>Smart with clickable status</guilabel> A smart multi-line, multi-item, status icons and clickable sort icons.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><guilabel>Configure...</guilabel> Allows you to customize your own Message List Theme &eg; add or remove columns from the clickable sort bar.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
If you have chosen a theme with a clickable status, you may sort the messages by clicking on the column that you wish to sort;
if you click on the same column more than once, sort order will toggle between ascending/descending and some alternative sorting criteria will become
available (like sorting by Status when you click on the header of the Subject column). Clicking the &RMB; on the list header shows a pop up menu,
which allows you to show or hide several columns in the list. You can customize the columns visible on the sort bar, see <link linkend="customize-messagelist-theme">Configure Appearance Message List</link> for details.

<title>Creating &HTML; Messages</title>

<para>Note that &HTML; messages are often regarded as an annoyance; therefore,
you should avoid sending &HTML; messages if possible. Particularly, you should never
send &HTML; messages to a mailing list unless &HTML; messages are explicitly
allowed.</para>

<para>In order to be able to create &HTML; messages you first have to enable
the markup tools. To do this enable <guimenuitem>Rich text editing</guimenuitem> in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Options</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.
A toolbar with several tools to
format the message will appear. Via the drop down box you can select between
standard text and six different types of lists (three bulleted lists with 
different symbols and three numbered lists with different numbering).
Moreover, you can select the font family, the font size, the font style (bold,
italic, underlined) and the text color. Last but not least, you can select
the alignment of the text (left aligned, centered, right aligned).</para>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Once a file is attached to your message, it appears in the attachments
pane at the bottom of the composer window. You can use the
&RMB; on each attachment to <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>View</guimenuitem>,
<guimenuitem>Save As...</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Remove</guimenuitem>
the attachment.</para>

<para>Use the <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item to
open the <guilabel>Message Part Properties</guilabel> dialog.
The first field contains the attachment's &MIME; type. Just like the <guilabel>Name</guilabel>
field, it should be automatically filled with an appropriate value. Sometimes the
&MIME; type value may be wrong. You can then type in any &MIME; type or
choose from the list of common &MIME; types. You can also select an encoding
method for your file from the list of encoding options (normally, the default
value works fine). Check the <guilabel>Suggest automatic display</guilabel> option 
if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this attachment. Whether this works or not depends on the recipient's email client
and on his settings.</para>

<para>You can also attach public keys to the message by using the appropriate options in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Attach</guimenu></menuchoice> menu. <application>GnuPG</application>
key attachments are handled like file attachments.</para>

A snippet editor dialog will appear, in which new text can be added and the snippet can be given a name. Also a <guilabel>Shortcut</guilabel> can be associated with the snippet. 
Snippets can be grouped together as well by creating groups and adding snippets to a particular group. If you want to view the stored text in a tooltip window keep the mouse cursor over the title of that snippet.
</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Snippets</guilabel> tool allows for a variable text in predefined places any time you insert a snippet into a file. To accomplish this  <guilabel>Snippets</guilabel> provides its own variables mechanism. You can insert variables in the snippet text itself by using separators ( $ ) that enclose the variable names. For example: $variablename$, $invoicenumber$, $weekno$.
</para>

<title>Message Filters</title>
<anchor id="filters-id"/>

<para>After using &kmail; for a while, you may find that you have trouble
sorting out the new messages in your inbox when they arrive. Filters allow you
to automatically perform certain actions on incoming messages and to manually
perform actions on selected messages in a folder.</para>

<para>Filters consist of: filter criteria, whose rules are used as
criteria to determine whether this filter should be applied to a given
message; and a list of filter actions, which describe what is to be
done with, or to, the message if the search pattern matches. Read more
about filter criteria and filter actions in the following
subsections.</para>

<note><para>Filters are considered one after the other,
starting with the first filter in the list. The first one whose
pattern matches the given message gets executed; you can request that
the remaining filters also be applied, but the default is to stop
processing at the first matching filter. </para></note>

<para>Usually, filters are used on incoming messages, but they can
also be applied to sent messages or to an arbitrary message or group
of messages. To selectively filter messages, select the messages you
want to filter in the message list and either type <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>J</keycap> </keycombo> or select
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filter</guimenuitem></menuchoice>: this will apply all filters that
have been marked for manual filtering in the <link
linkend="filter-dialog">filter dialog</link> to those messages.</para>

<sect2 id="filter-quick">
<title>Fast Filter Creation</title>

<para>There are two methods for creating a filter; the quick method is
to use <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guimenuitem>Create
Filter</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and select a criteria from the submenu: this will call the filter dialog
and present you with a new filter which has the first rule of the
search pattern and the first action (as <guilabel>Move into Folder</guilabel>) 
preset. In most cases, all you have to do is select the folder where the message
should be moved to; but you can, of course, edit the filter as you
like.</para>

<para>When creating a filter on mailing list messages this method 
will try really hard to find a criterion that
uniquely identifies messages from that list; If it succeeds, the guessed
name of the list is presented in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create
Filter</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Filter on
Mailing-List...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu entry.</para>

<para>The second method is to manually construct a filter from scratch
by calling the filter dialog through
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure 
Filters...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The filter dialog is described in
detail in the following subsection.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="filter-dialog">
<title>The Filter Dialog</title>
<anchor id="filter-dialog-id"/>

<para>This dialog allows you to manage and edit your list of
filters.</para>

<para>You can reach it either via
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create

<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Available Filters</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>This group contains the list of filters and some action
buttons to modify the filters, namely: to create new filters; to move them up or 
down the list; to delete them; or to rename them. If you select
a filter from the list, its properties are shown in the right-hand half
of the dialog.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Filter Criteria</guilabel></term> <listitem><para>In
this group you can edit the pattern that messages must match for the

defined rules must match or whether it suffices that any one of them
matches. See <link linkend="filter-criteria">Search Patterns</link>
below for a detailed description of each search rule type.</para>

<para> You can click on <guibutton>More</guibutton> to get an
additional (initially empty) rule if you want to define more-complex

</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Advanced Options</guilabel></term>

<listitem>

<para>In this group you can define a few advanced options for filters
that allow you to refine your filtering.</para>

<para>Using the first row of check boxes, you can toggle when the
filter is applied: the <guilabel>Apply this filter to incoming messages</guilabel>
option means that the filter is applied to messages when you receive
them (&ie; on <guiicon>Check Mail</guiicon>).
The filter can be applied to all messages, to all but online IMAP accounts and
to a selection of incoming folders.</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Apply this filter to sent
messages</guilabel> option means that the filter is applied to
messages when you send them and the <guilabel>Apply this filter on manual
filtering</guilabel> option controls whether to apply this filter when
filtering is specifically selected (&ie; via
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filters</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.)</para>
<para>If <guilabel>Apply this filter to sent messages</guilabel> is checked
the filter will be triggered <emphasis>after</emphasis> the message is sent and it will 
only affect the local copy of the message. If the recipient's copy 
also needs to be modified, please use <guilabel>Apply this filter before 
sending messages</guilabel>.
</para>
<para>The <guilabel>If this filter matches, stop processing here</guilabel>
check box controls whether or not the filters after
the current filter will be applied, if the current filter matches.</para>

<para>If the <guilabel>Add this filter to the Apply Filter menu</guilabel>
check box is selected, this filter will be inserted
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filter</guimenuitem></menuchoice> submenu. You can then apply this
filter to a message. Another way of applying filters is to use
<menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Apply
Filters</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu option, which applies <emphasis>all</emphasis>
the filters - one after another until they are all used or one of the
filters that matches has the <guilabel>If the filters matches, stop
processing here</guilabel>.</para>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<note><para>Filters are automatically named unless you explicitly
rename them using the <guibutton>Rename...</guibutton> button.
The dialog assumes that it should continue auto-naming the filter
as long as the filter name starts with <quote>&lt;</quote>.
</para></note>

<note>
<para>If you apply filter changes, via
<guibutton>OK</guibutton> or <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>, only valid
filters are actually copied to the internal filter manager.</para>

<para>Similarly, empty rules and actions are removed from the pattern
and action list respectively, before the filter is saved.</para>

also as forwarded, replied, &etc;</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Send Fake MDN</guilabel></term>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Set Transport To</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This will set the method of transport (&eg; &SMTP;)
that will be used if you reply to the message.</para>

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Set Reply-To To</guilabel></term>

which you do not like.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Forward To</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>This will forward the message inline (&ie; as if you selected <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Inline...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) to another email address.

confirmations in the <guilabel>Configure &kmail;...</guilabel> dialog
(<link linkend="configure-security"><guilabel>Security</guilabel>

makes tracking of spam messages, for example, very easy for the sender.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Execute Command</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This will execute a program, but will not modify the
message. Specify the full path to the program you want to
execute; &kmail; will then block until the program returns.
If you do not want &kmail; to block then append '&amp;' to the command.
You can feed
the program with the parts of the mail: <symbol>&percnt;0</symbol>,
<symbol>&percnt;1</symbol>, &etc; stand for files representing
the message parts; for common messages <symbol>&percnt;0</symbol> is the
text, <symbol>&percnt;1</symbol> the first attachment and so
on. Additionally, the whole message is fed into the program's
<acronym>stdin</acronym>; and every occurrence of
<symbol>&percnt;{foo}</symbol> is replaced by the content of the foo
header. If you need to identify the message via its storage location in the
Akonadi store, you can use the %{itemid} or %{itemurl} placeholders to
achieve that.</para>

<!-- fixme: still correct? -->
<warning><para>This currently only works if the message has
<emphasis>at least one</emphasis> attachment. No, not even
<symbol>&percnt;0</symbol> will work in the general
case!</para></warning>

<tip><para> You can enter arbitrarily-complex shell commands here,
since &kmail; uses a sub shell to execute the command line; therefore,
even this command will work (within its limits):
<userinput><command>uudecode</command> <option>-o</option>
<parameter>$(mktemp kmail-uudecoded.XXXXXX)</parameter> &amp;&amp;

<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Pipe Through</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>This will feed the message to a program: if the program returns
output, the entire message (including the headers) will be replaced
with this output; if the program does not return output or exits
with a return code other than 0 (indicating an error occurred), the message
will not change.  Specify the full path to the program. The same
substitutions (<symbol>&percnt;n</symbol>,
<symbol>&percnt;{foo}</symbol> as with <guilabel>execute
command</guilabel> are performed on the command line.</para>
<warning><para>Be cautious with this action, as it will easily mess up
your messages if the filter program returns garbage or extra
lines.</para></warning>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Remove Header</guilabel></term>

<quote>Reply-To:</quote> headers.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Add Header</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>If no such field is already present this will add a new header field
with the given name and value to the message; if there already is a
header field with that name, it is overwritten with the 
given value; if there are already multiple headers with the given
name (&eg; <quote>Received:</quote> headers), an arbitrary one of them is
overwritten and the others are left unchanged -- this is a known
limitation. You may want to combine this filter with the
<guilabel>remove header</guilabel> filter above to make sure that
there are no other headers with that name in the message.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>Rewrite Header</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>Will scan the given header field, modify its contents and write
it back. The search string is always interpreted as a case-sensitive
regular expression. The replacement string is inserted literally
except for occurrences of <userinput>\n</userinput>,
<userinput>$n</userinput> and <userinput>${nn}</userinput>, where
<userinput>n</userinput> is a positive (single-digit, except for the
third form) number or <userinput>0</userinput>. These constructs are
interpreted as back references to substrings captured with parentheses
in the search string.</para><para>Analogous restrictions as in the

<para>If I am subscribed to the (general) &kde; List, I could create a
folder for the list (I will call it
<replaceable>KDE-General</replaceable>) and use a filter to
automatically transfer new messages from my inbox to my
<replaceable>KDE-General</replaceable> folder if they are from the
&kde; List. Here is how to create this filter:</para>

<procedure>
<title>Filtering a mailing list</title>
<step>
<para>Try if <menuchoice><guimenu>Message</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create
filter</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Filter on
Mailing-List...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> can identify the mailing
list (the name of the list should then appear in the menu item); in
this case, this works and I am presented a filter that has
<quote>List-Id <guilabel>contains</guilabel>
&lt;kde.kde.org&gt;</quote> preset. You select the
desired destination folder from the folder pull-down menu in the
<guilabel>Filter Action</guilabel> group and that is it.</para>

<para>If that does not work, think of a unique way of identifying the
messages you want to filter. The (almost) unique property of my &kde;
List messages is that they always contain
<quote>kde@kde.org</quote> in the
<guilabel>To:</guilabel> or <guilabel>CC:</guilabel> field. It is only
almost unique, because this fails for cross-posted messages.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Select <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure 
Filters...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Press the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button to create an empty
filter. It will appear as <guilabel>&lt;unknown&gt;</guilabel>.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>In the <guilabel> Filter Criteria</guilabel> area, select
<guilabel>All Recipients</guilabel> from the first drop down box,
<guilabel>contains</guilabel> from the second drop down box, and type
<userinput>kde@kde.org</userinput> in the text
field.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Skip down to the <guilabel>Filter Actions</guilabel> section. Select <guilabel>Move Into
Folder</guilabel> from the first drop down box. Click on the folder icon and a window
containing a list of folders will appear. Select the folder that you
want the filtered messages to be transferred to. For this example, you would select
<guilabel>KDE-General</guilabel>.</para>
</step>
</procedure>

<para>You may find that you need to use more powerful criteria to
properly filter your messages; for example, you may only want to
filter the &kde; List messages that are written by your friend <replaceable>Fred
Johnson &lt;fj@anywhere.com&gt;</replaceable>. This is where the rest of the
matching criteria section comes into play:</para>

<procedure>
<title>Extending the filter</title>
<step>
<para>Open up the <guilabel>Configure Filters...</guilabel> window and select
the filter you just created.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Since you want to filter all messages that have
<replaceable>kde@kde.org</replaceable> in the
<guilabel>To:</guilabel> or <guilabel>CC:</guilabel> field
<emphasis>and</emphasis> that are from Fred, check the
<guibutton>Match all of the following</guibutton> radio
button.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Now, go to the second search rule and select the following from
the pull-down menus: <guilabel>From</guilabel>,
<guilabel>contains</guilabel>. Now, type
<userinput>fj@anywhere.com</userinput> in the text field.</para>

<title>Filter Optimization</title>

<para>It is important to know that, for example, the order of the
filters has an  impact on the speed of the filter process. Here are
some ideas which can help you to improve the filtering:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Stop filter processing as early as possible:</term>
<listitem>
<para>If you know that a filter finally processes a certain class of 
messages, please make sure to check the option <guilabel>If this filter 
matches, stop processing here</guilabel> for the filter. 
This will avoid the evaluation of the filter rules of all subsequent
filters. (See the advanced options in the <link linkend="filter-dialog-id">
Filter Dialog</link>).</para>
<para>An example is filtering messages from mailing lists via List-Id
header into separate folders. Having found out that a message came from 
list A means that you can avoid checking the next filter for messages
from list B.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Consider the costs of the evaluation of filter rules:</term>
<listitem>
<para>The time required to evaluate a filter rule depends on the way
the rule is constructed. In particular, scanning for a
substring using the <guilabel>contains</guilabel> operation is faster
than a pattern matching using the <guilabel>matches regular
expr.</guilabel> operation.
</para>
<para>Another dependency is on the amount of data which is used for the
evaluation of a filter rule. If the rule is based on a message header,
its evaluation should normally be much faster than the evaluation of 
a rule based on the complete message.
</para>
<para>You should try to keep the filter rules as simple as possible.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry>
<term>Check the order of your filters:</term>
<listitem>
<para>All the different filter actions have a different complexity. 
The most expensive filter actions are <guilabel>Pipe Through</guilabel> 
and <guilabel>Execute Command</guilabel>, because both need external 
programs to be run. Placing filters containing these filter actions
behind other filters that can reduce the number of times these complex
actions are required is useful, if the filter logic does allow
this.</para> 
<para>An example is filtering messages from a mailing list and detecting 
spam messages. For the spam detection you will usually use an external 
tool via a <guilabel>Pipe Through</guilabel> action. Filtering the messages 
for the mailing list is done via the List-Id header. If you do not want to 
check the messages from the mailing list for spam too, it is better to
use the filter for the mailing list messages before the filter for the 
spam detection. This way you avoid the expensive and slow spam check for all
messages which were identified as mailing list messages.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="filter-logging">
<title>Filter Log</title>
<para>If you want to verify that your filters work as intended, you can
open a viewer for the filter log via <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu>

</para>
<para>In the viewer, there you can configure  the logging of the filter 
processing. You can control the detail level of the log, clear the log 
or save the log into a file. The log can provide valuable information if 
you need to debug your filtering process.

<title>Signing and Encrypting Messages with <application>GnuPG</application></title>

<!--
<note><para>There have been major changes in the way &kmail; handles 
signing/encryption. The following introduction applies to the previous
version of &kmail;. You can still read the introduction to get an overview
about how to sign/encrypt messages, but the details, especially those of
the configuration, will differ.</para></note>
-->
<para>This is a short introduction on how to setup &kmail;'s
<application>GnuPG</application> (<application>&GNU; Privacy Guard</application>) support;
it gives some hints on the use of
<application>GnuPG</application> too. It is written for people who are beginners in
this area; if you are familiar with the use of <application>GnuPG</application>, you can
skip most of the steps.</para>

<para>Please
also check out the <link linkend="pgp-faq">&FAQ; item about
<application>GnuPG</application></link>.</para>

<warning><para>Attachments will not be signed/encrypted if you are using
inline OpenPGP: to sign/encrypt attachments, you have to install GnuPG and
some necessary libraries;
then, you can decide for each attachment whether it should be signed/encrypted or not.
</para></warning>

<warning><para>&kmail; has to rely on <application>GnuPG</application>'s
output; this output is often different between different versions of 
<application>GnuPG</application>, so it is important that you test if encryption
really works with your setup before you start using it seriously. &kmail; might
<emphasis>not</emphasis> warn you if something fails -- enable 
<guilabel>Show signed/encrypted text
after composing</guilabel>.  </para></warning>

<para>To setup and use <application>GnuPG</application> support in &kmail; it is
necessary to have <application>GnuPG</application> installed and set up
properly; of course, we cannot give you a full introduction of
<application>GnuPG</application> here. We will only mention the steps you have to
do to get <application>GnuPG</application> going. For details you should have a look at 
the <ulink url="http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html#guides">The &GNU; Privacy Handbook</ulink>.</para>

<para>It is certainly a good idea to study this documentation as well as an
introduction into public key cryptography: there you can learn a lot about
the basic concepts, which will help you to understand what is going on; also,
many security related issues you should know about are discussed there.</para>

<para>Now, let us start.</para>

<sect2 id="pgp-preconditions">
<title>Preconditions</title>

<para>&kmail; expects that your <application>GnuPG</application> binary is called
<command>gpg</command>. If this is not the case for you,
just make a symlink.</para>

<para>If you have not done so, you have to generate a key pair (secret and public
key) for your identity. Either do that using &kgpg; or &kleopatra; or do this at the command line: 
<userinput><command>gpg</command> <option>--gen-key</option></userinput>: &kmail;
has no internal support for <application>gpg</application>'s key generation at
this time. The identity (normally your name followed by your email address
within brackets, such as <userinput>John Doe
&lt;john@example.com&gt;</userinput>) and your passphrase are important for the
co-operation between &kmail; and <application>GnuPG</application>.</para>

<para>Now you are able to sign outgoing messages; to let people send you
encrypted messages and to let them verify your signature you
must send them your public key or upload your public key to a public
<application>GnuPG</application> key server so that they can fetch your key from there.
To send encrypted messages to other people or to verify their signed

<para>You can compose your message as usual in the composer
window of &kmail;. Before you send the message, check the <guibutton>Sign</guibutton>

the message. The identity you are using to write the current message needs to 
be connected to an <guilabel>OpenPGP Key</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Identity</guilabel>
section of the <guilabel>Configure</guilabel> dialog.
To sign the message, &kmail; needs to know your <application>GnuPG</application> 
passphrase: if you did not select <guilabel>Keep passphrase in memory</guilabel> in the
<guilabel>Security</guilabel> section, &kmail; will ask you for it; otherwise,
if you have already given the phrase to &kmail;, it will sign the
message without any further prompt.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="pgp-encrypt-your-messages">
<title>Encrypt your Messages</title>

<para>To send an encrypted message to somebody whose
public key you have, you simply create the message in the composer window.
Before you send the message, check the <guibutton>Encrypt</guibutton> 
button in the toolbar of the composer window; note
that you might not have to check the button if <guilabel>Automatically

&kmail;'s configuration (see <link linkend="pgp-sign-your-messages">above</link>).
Then send the message.</para>

<para>

cannot find a matching key for a recipient, it will display a list containing
all available keys in the <guilabel>Encryption Key Selection</guilabel> dialog;
if &kmail; finds more than one trusted key for a recipient, it will
display a list containing all matching keys for this recipient. In both
cases you can select the key(s) which should be used for encrypting
this message for the recipient in question.
Using the <guilabel>Remember choice</guilabel>

the <guilabel>Encryption Key Approval</guilabel> dialog will appear;
here, you can select different keys for the recipients and can 
set the <guilabel>Encryption Preference</guilabel> for each recipient.
The default option, <guilabel>Encrypt whenever encryption is

defined for the current identity to the message. Now you can send the message.</para>

<para>Remember that it is not safe at all if you sign the message to make sure
that the receiver will get the correct key: there can be a man-in-the-middle
attack, as somebody can change the key and sign the message with that other

<para>You can activate the wizard via <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Anti-Spam Wizard...</guisubmenu></menuchoice>.</para>

<para>The wizard scans for known anti-spam tools on your computer. 
It is also possible to use the results of spam checks made by your service provider
by evaluating header information which has been added to the messages.
You can let the wizard prepare &kmail; to use one or more of these in parallel.
However, note that anti-spam tool operations are usually time consuming.
&kmail; can appear to be frozen during the scan of messages for spam;
you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of &kmail;. Please consider 
deleting the filter rules created by the wizard if the filtering becomes 
too slow for you. 
Here are some recommendations regarding the supported tools:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
  <term>Bogofilter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Bogofilter is a bayesian filter, that means its spam detection 
relies on an initial training phase. On the other hand, it's a pretty 
fast tool. That's why it is recommended to be used by people who 
primarily want to have fast spam detection, and who won't worry
about the initial training before the detection rate
increases significantly.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
  <term>SpamAssassin</term>
<listitem>
<para>SpamAssassin is a pretty complex tool to use against spam.
Although its behavior depends heavily on its configuration,
it can detect spam quite well without any training. However,
scanning a message takes a little longer compared to pure bayesian 
filters. Let's say it's not the tool of choice for people without
some background information about SpamAssassin's capabilities.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
  <term>Annoyance-Filter</term>
<listitem>
<para>Perhaps not so often used until distributions pick it up.
It's clearly a tool for specialists.

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
  <term>GMX Spam Filter</term>
<listitem>
<para>If you get your mail via the GMX freemail provider,
your messages are already scanned for spam. The result of that process is
documented in a special header field of each message. It's possible to
use the content of this header field to sort out spam. There is no 
slowdown in the filtering if only this tool is used, as the messages
have already been processed.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>


</sect2>

<sect2 id="spam-wizard-advanced">
<title>Advanced</title>

<para>Here are the details of how the wizard works: &kmail; can use several 
external tools to detect spam messages; it will try to automatically find 
out which tools are installed on your system and will show you these
in a list. The list is ordered by the average speed of the filtering
process of the tools. You can mark the tools which you want 
to be used by &kmail; to detect spam. Of course, you 
can close the wizard, install a new tool, and restart the wizard again.
</para>

<para>If you have marked at least one tool, &kmail; is able to provide filters
which allow the classification of the messages as spam or not spam. It will 
also provide actions to let you manually classify messages. These actions will 
be available via the menu and toolbar icons.
If any of the tools you selected support Bayesian filtering (&ie; a method 
to detect spam based on statistical analysis of the messages) then these 
messages are not only marked but additionally transferred to the tools to
enable them to learn thereby improving their detection rate.
</para>

<para>On the second page, you will be able to select some additional
actions to be performed in &kmail; with regard to spam messages: if you
want messages detected as spam to be moved into a certain folder, select
the appropriate folder and mark the <guilabel>Move known spam to:</guilabel> 
option; if messages detected as spam should additionally be marked as read, 
then mark the <guilabel>Mark detected spam messages as read</guilabel> option.
</para>

<para>Selecting at least one of the available tools will allow
the wizard to finish the filter setup. The wizard will not take any
modifications in existing filters, formerly created by it, into
consideration but will either append new filters or replace existing filters.
In any case you may want to inspect the result of this process in the
<link linkend="filter-dialog">Filter Dialog</link>. 
The wizard will also create toolbar buttons for marking messages as spam or
as ham; keep in mind that classifying messages as spam will also move those 
messages to the folder you had specified for spam messages, if you have
selected the appropriate option.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="spam-wizard-details">

<filename>kmail.antispamrc</filename> (stored in the global or local &kde;
config directory). It will first check the global config file and then the local 
config file: if the local config file contains entries with higher (newer) 
version numbers per-tool the configuration data from the local file for that 
tool is used; that way, both administrators and users can update the
wizard configuration.
</para>

<para>The local detection of spam messages is achieved by creating 
<guilabel>pipe through</guilabel> actions per-tool within a 
special filter. Another filter contains rules to check for detected spam 
messages and actions to mark them and (optionally, depending on the choice 
in the wizard) to move them into a folder. Both filters are configured to 
be applied on incoming messages and on manual filtering.
</para>

<para>Two filters are needed for the classification of ham and spam. They
contain actions to mark the messages appropriately. As mentioned above, the
filter for classification as spam can have another supplementary action to
move the messages into a predefined folder. If the selected tools support
Bayesian filtering, the wizard will create additional filter actions to pass
the messages to the tools (via <guilabel>execute command</guilabel> actions)
in the appropriate learning mode.

<para>&kmail; does not have a built-in virus detection solution: the developers believe 
using external, but specialized, tools is the better approach. &kmail; uses these tools 
through its flexible filter architecture. The Anti-Virus Wizard helps you with the

<title>Advanced</title>

<para>The Anti-Virus Wizard basically works exactly as the 
<link linkend="the-anti-spam-wizard">Anti-Spam Wizard</link> does.
Here are the details of how the wizard works: &kmail; can use several 
external tools to detect messages containing viruses; it will try to automatically find 
out which of these tools are installed on your system and will show you the
result of the search. You can mark the tools which you want
to be used by &kmail; to detect viruses. Of course, you
can close the wizard, install a new tool, and restart the wizard again.
</para>

<para>If you have chosen at least one tool you will be able to select actions
to be done in &kmail; to messages containing viruses: to let &kmail; detect
messages containing viruses you definitely should mark the <guilabel>Check messages using the
anti-virus tools</guilabel> option; if you want messages detected as 
virus-infected to be moved into a certain folder, select the appropriate folder and
mark the <guilabel>Move detected viral messages to the selected folder</guilabel> 
option; if messages detected as virus-infected should additionally be marked as read,
then mark the <guilabel>Additionally, mark detected viral messages as read</guilabel> option.
</para>

<para>Selecting at least one of these options will allow
the wizard to finish the filter setup. The wizard will not take any existing
filter rules into consideration but will append new rules. In any case you
may want to inspect the result of this process in the 
<link linkend="filter-dialog">Filter Dialog</link>.
