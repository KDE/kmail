Just a little reminder of what to do when a release comes near:

- Make sure everything important is backported
- Change the version number, both in trunk and in the branches (kmversion.h)
- Add the new version numbers to bugzilla
- Also, change the year in kmversion.h when the time comes
- Add bugfixes to the changelog at svn+ssh://tmcguire@svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/www/sites/www/announcements/changelogs
- For major releases, make sure the feature plan is up-to-date
- Make sure it doesn't crash at startup or similar catastrophes :)
