1998-06-22  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.6)

	* fixed a whole bunch of stuff that made kmail segfault.

1998-06-21  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* small fix for quicker response in kmnewiostatus.cpp

	* "Delete folder" dialog now defaults to "No" (compliant to 
	KDE standards)

1998-06-20  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmsender.cpp (cleanup): Fixed the sendQueued problem.
	If only one message from the outbox couldnt get sent all
	following messages got deleted from the outbox. This is fixed now.
	

1998-06-19  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.6)

	* Folder: fixed broken locking on systems without
	flock(). Thanks to Werner Ertle <wer@christl.hl.siemens.de>
	who sent me the patch.

1998-06-18  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.5)

	* Deleting folders crashed kmail. Fixed.

	* Folder-compacting: added busy pointer and progress
	output in the status bar (idea from Mario).	

	* Reader: removed ':' from the characters that mark
	quoted text to catch smileys at the beginning of the
	line ;-)

	* Main window configuration (geometry, etc.) is now
	stored again.

	* Composer: changed completion key from Ctrl-. to Ctrl-T
	as kfile has.

1998-06-18  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Dialog for folder selection: Escape now closes dialog,
	remembers last folder, has a default pushbutton

1998-06-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.4)

	* Message-list: now the first unread/new message is
	displayed when opening a folder.

	* Message-status: now messages change status from
	"new" to "unread" when the user changes folder (and
	not when the folder is closed somewhere within KMail).

	* Reader: worked around problem of current HTML widget
	with long lines (without '\n')

1998-06-16  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.3)

	* Headers: Improved switching between folders to do
	less paints to avoid flickering where possible.

	* Warnings: changed warning messages of QPixmap and
	QPainter to debug messages to avoid lots of message
	boxes from broken KToolbar code when changing color 
	scheme.

	* Composer (email-address-completion)
	Changed email-address completion to be case insensitive.
	I think this is more useful in the general case.

	* Composer: fixed broken Tab handling. Replaced
	Tab-completion in the email-address header lines 
	(To, From, Cc, etc.) with Ctrl-. completion.

	* Filters: removed some debug statements that slowed
	down filtering a lot.

	* kmmsgbase.cpp: added isUnread() method.

	* Message-list: improved next/prev_unread_message methods.
	Improved code that ensures that current item is visible
	and added it to several places in the headers code.

1998-06-15  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* kmfilteraction.cpp (process): Removed patch for kmfilter
	action "Move" of 1998-06-14.
	Fixed bug in kmfilteraction "Move" action.

	* Fonts: reader- and composer-window now change
	their font when the settings are changed.

	* Shutdown: improved handling of window-close and
	KMail shutdown- and crash-handling.
	

1998-06-14  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmfilteraction.cpp (process): Applied patch for kmfilter
	actionmove.

1998-06-13  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.2)

	* key for next_unread_message and prev_unread_message added

1998-06-12  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Folder loading: moved status message in index
	creation to a more suitable place. Should be lots
	faster now.

	* Composer: Now path of last filedialog for attachments
	is stored.

	* Fonts: improved font settings. The HTML widget
	unfortunately only honors the font family. Added new
	functions (kfontutils.h) for easy font to/from string
	conversion.

1998-06-12  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.1)
	* new sort algorithm - quicksort instead of bubble-sort

1998-06-11  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.0)

	* Initial start now opens the settings dialog. Don't
	be alerted, this will happen once for everybody now ;-)

	* Fonts: implemented font setting for HTML widget,
	list of messages, and composer.

	* Drag&Drop: implemented drag&drop of messages to
	folders. Dropping into HTML widget crashes KMail. 
	Could be a bug of the HTML widget, however.

	* Move-message: improved folder selection dialog.

	* Message-list: now cleared properly when the current
	folder is deleted.

1998-06-11  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.9)

	* KMail now uses KFileDialog only!

1998-06-11  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.9)
	
	* "P" and "N" (next and previous mail) will cause the header
	list to be scrolled if the new item is not visible

	* fixed some code to prevent compiler warning

	* panner position is now (again) restored
	
1998-06-07  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.8)

	* Folders: changed message about index-recreation
	to debug from warning.

	* Message/Headers: Email addresses like <joe@home.org>
	(with the <> around the address) no longer lead to
	an empty field in the message list.

	* Headers: Removed extra space in header line(s).

	* Headers: Empty Subject moved From and Date one column
	left. Fixed (hopefully).

	* Composer: Send again did not decode quoted-printable
	sent messages. Fixed.

	* PGP: KMail did not ask for mantra upon first reading of
	an encrypted message. Applied patch, from Michael Vogel 
	<icarus@hades.pop-celle.de>, which hopefully works :-)

1998-05-13  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.7)

	* Filters: Bugfix: when deleting a folder that was the target
	of a filter the next get-mails crashed.

	* Filter Dialog: Deleting filter rules did not work. Fixed.

1998-05-09  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmsettings.cpp (KMAccountSettings):
	Fixed "Delete mail from server". The row was too low.
	* kmmainwin.cpp
	Added a single account mail check option.

1998-04-29  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* Reader: Fixed the url parsing which made kmail 
	loop.

1998-04-28  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.6)

	* Folders: Emptying of the trash folder resulted in an infinite 
	loop. Fixed now.

1998-04-04  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (Kde Beta-4)

	* Filters: Removed warning dialog. Filters are working ok for
	me for several weeks now.

	* Folders: After I finally also deleted lots of important messages
	by mistake I now changed the behaviour of Folder->Empty to
	move the messages into trash instead of deleting them ;-)
	This made the "Are you sure" dialog now obsolete, IMO.

1998-03-31  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.5)

	* Folders: fixed bug introduced on 1998-03-26: open failed on
	folders where lock() returned an error.

1998-03-28  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Headers: when opening a folder the contents was not automatically
	sorted, now is.

	* Pop: new messages retrieved from pop accounts were not
	marked new. Now fixed.

1998-03-26  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Folders: when opening and locking a folder there were
	cases (in fact most of the time) when the folder seemed
	to be not locked but was. Now this is handled better.

1998-03-24  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.4)

	* Message: decoding of quoted-printable RFC1522 strings
	was broken for strings that started with a decoded character.

1998-03-18  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Reader: improved detection of urls and email addresses
	to ignore special characters at the end, e.g. "." or ")".

	* Messagelist: finally fixed sorting of messages. Also
	implemented ascending/descending/none sorting (use multiple
	clicks on the column headers to switch). Sorting order "none"
	is what was IMO missing for the trash folder :-)

1998-03-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.3)

	* Composer: in menu view, when 'all headers' view is 
	activated, then the individual header line menu entries are 
	disabled now.

	* Folders: changed creation of folders to -rw-------
	instead of the default -rw-r--r--. Same for the initial
	creation of ~/Mail.

	* Attachments: temporary files (when viewing attachments)
	are now also created with permissions -rw-------.
	
1998-03-15  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.2)

	* Startup: added option -check which does mail checking
	upon startup. Also options that start with a '-' but which
	are unknown are now skipped.

1998-03-09  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.1)

	* Reader: '_' was not considered part of a smart-detected email
	address (auto detection of @).

	* Reader: attachments of type message/rfc822 are now shown
	in an external reader window if open or view from the attachment
	popup menu is chosen.

	* Composer: finally got insertion of tabs into message
	working.

(many changes are missing here, sorry)
	
1998-02-14  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Startup: when recovering dead letters the auto signature was 
	appended twice. Fixed now.

	* Composer: fixed broken inserting of files.

	* kFileToString(): fixed handling of files with zero length.

Initial version: 0.5.7
