1998-05-25  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.8)

	* Headers: Empty Subject moved From and Date one column
	left. Fixed (hopefully).

	* Composer: Send again did not decode quoted-printable
	sent messages. Fixed.

	* PGP: KMail did not ask for mantra upon first reading of
	an encrypted message. Applied patch, from Michael Vogel 
	<icarus@hades.pop-celle.de>, which hopefully works :-)

1998-05-13  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.7)

	* Filters: Bugfix: when deleting a folder that was the target
	of a filter the next get-mails crashed.

	* Filter Dialog: Deleting filter rules did not work. Fixed.

1998-05-09  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmsettings.cpp (KMAccountSettings):
	Fixed "Delete mail from server". The row was too low.
	* kmmainwin.cpp
	Added a single account mail check option.

1998-04-29  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* Reader: Fixed the url parsing which made kmail 
	loop.

1998-04-28  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.6)

	* Folders: Emptying of the trash folder resulted in an infinite 
	loop. Fixed now.

1998-04-04  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (Kde Beta-4)

	* Filters: Removed warning dialog. Filters are working ok for
	me for several weeks now.

	* Folders: After I finally also deleted lots of important messages
	by mistake I now changed the behaviour of Folder->Empty to
	move the messages into trash instead of deleting them ;-)
	This made the "Are you sure" dialog now obsolete, IMO.

1998-03-31  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.5)

	* Folders: fixed bug introduced on 1998-03-26: open failed on
	folders where lock() returned an error.

1998-03-28  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Headers: when opening a folder the contents was not automatically
	sorted, now is.

	* Pop: new messages retrieved from pop accounts were not
	marked new. Now fixed.

1998-03-26  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Folders: when opening and locking a folder there were
	cases (in fact most of the time) when the folder seemed
	to be not locked but was. Now this is handled better.

1998-03-24  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.4)

	* Message: decoding of quoted-printable RFC1522 strings
	was broken for strings that started with a decoded character.

1998-03-18  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Reader: improved detection of urls and email addresses
	to ignore special characters at the end, e.g. "." or ")".

	* Messagelist: finally fixed sorting of messages. Also
	implemented ascending/descending/none sorting (use multiple
	clicks on the column headers to switch). Sorting order "none"
	is what was IMO missing for the trash folder :-)

1998-03-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.3)

	* Composer: in menu view, when 'all headers' view is 
	activated, then the individual header line menu entries are 
	disabled now.

	* Folders: changed creation of folders to -rw-------
	instead of the default -rw-r--r--. Same for the initial
	creation of ~/Mail.

	* Attachments: temporary files (when viewing attachments)
	are now also created with permissions -rw-------.
	
1998-03-15  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.2)

	* Startup: added option -check which does mail checking
	upon startup. Also options that start with a '-' but which
	are unknown are now skipped.

1998-03-09  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.1)

	* Reader: '_' was not considered part of a smart-detected email
	address (auto detection of @).

	* Reader: attachments of type message/rfc822 are now shown
	in an external reader window if open or view from the attachment
	popup menu is chosen.

	* Composer: finally got insertion of tabs into message
	working.

(many changes are missing here, sorry)
	
1998-02-14  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Startup: when recovering dead letters the auto signature was 
	appended twice. Fixed now.

	* Composer: fixed broken inserting of files.

	* kFileToString(): fixed handling of files with zero length.

Initial version: 0.5.7
