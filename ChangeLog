	first.

1999-01-23  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.14)

	"long folder list" and "short folder list". Option
	setable in settings->appearance.
	
	* New feature: the "From" column now contains the
	receiver for the folders outbox and sent-mail. Column
	"Sender" automatically switches it's title to "Receiver"

1999-01-21  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.13)

	Now it is possible to have more folders than the screen
	is high and still select them in the filter dialog.
	* Filter Dialog: changed folder combo box to (semi) auto
	resize. Changed layout of dialog to better display all
	elements. Also enabled vertical resizing of dialog.

	  encoding switchings.

1998-12-21  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	Applied several patches from Lars Heete <hel@admin.de>:
        * missing deletion of drop zone in composer destructor 
	* handling of NULL status field in message base
	* reading process status of finished pgp process to avoid
	  zombies ;-)
	* workaround for "Could not load..." warnings, that should
	  rather be debug messages, in message handler

1998-12-20  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.10)

	* Fixed possible crash when subject is empty.

1998-12-17  Juraj Bednar     <bednar@isternet.sk>

        * Added the capatability to insert arbitary public keys from public
          keyring. (PGP)

1998-12-16  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.9)

	* Switched busy pointer (if not animated) and hand cursor 
	to new KCursor class.

	* Headers: status of message is now set to read also for
	messages that are displayed when the folder is opened.

1998-12-07  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Updated documentation

1998-12-06  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Added i18n() around label in folder list.

1998-12-03  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.8)

	* New messages: added organization to message header
	if given.

	* Headers: position of top message in folder list is
	stored and reused upon next opening. Exception: if there
	is a new or unread message in the folder, then the
	first new/unread message is shown.

	* Composer: fixed missing last character in replies.

	* Composer: attachments are now included in forwards.

1998-11-24  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Pop: does not stop pop retrieval now when pop server does
	not understand LAST command.

1998-11-15  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.7)

	* Headers: now current message is not reset when reading mails
	and checking for new messages meanwhile.

	* Pop: added configuration option for leave-mail-on-server.

	* Pop: Fixed problems in pop authentication code.

	* Pop: Enabled POP3 LAST command which was commited to
	kdesupport some time ago.

1998-11-15  Alex Zepeda  <garbanzo@hooked.net>

	* kfontutils.cpp (kfontToStr): Cast two const char *'s to char *'s as
	egcs seems to barf without the casts.

1998-11-10  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* Removed hardcoded localkdedir()

	* Let KApplication() do the job of creating ~/.kde/share/config

1998-10-31  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.6)

	* Fixed: crash when fetching new mail and inbox folder
	is not accessible.

1998-10-21  Lars Knoll <knoll@mpi-hd.mpg.de>
	* fixed a bug in the support for pgp-2.6

1998-10-08  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-1.0.5)

	* Sorting messages: replaced sorting algorithm, which caused
	random hangs, with stock qsort -- hopefully working now ;-)

	* Fixed: folder list went out of scope (current item pointing to
	nowhere) when folder was deleted.

	* Composer: fixed broken confirm-close dialog.

	* Increased version to better match upcoming Kde-1.1 release.

	* Added call to kapp->quit() when last window is closed.

1998-10-05  Lars Knoll <knoll@mpi-hd.mpg.de>
	* Added new pgp classes. They should fix a lot of problems
	with the current support of pgp5.0 and pgp2.6, and fix all
	security problems with the old versions of kpgp, since all
	comunication with pgp (including the passphrase) is done via
	pipes.
	
1998-09-26  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.8.1)

	* Fixed crash upon close of a main- or composer window.
	Bug seems to be introduced by changed behaviour of KTMainWindow.
	Still KMail crashes when you click on any message afterwards.

	* Addressbook: finally fixed bug in not reading last line.
	Thanks to all who reported!

	* Replaced occurances of KTopLevelWidget with KTMainWindow.

1998-09-21  Markus Wuebben  <markus@office.DInet.de>

	* added a short cut for mail checking

1998-09-12  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* some nice little fixes

1998-09-11  Juraj Bednar    <bednar@isternet.sk>

	* finally wrote PGP replying and forwarding decryption
	* PGP 5.0i should work now with no problems (should ;-)

Sun Sep  6 19:20:34 1998  Markus Wuebben  <mason@HoneyBunny.uni-dortmund.de>

	* kmacctpop.cpp (setPasswd): Fixed password problem.

Sun Sep  6 18:28:45 1998  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmreaderwin.cpp :  Finally fixed attachment problem

1998-07-31  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmsettings.cpp / kmmainwin.cpp Implemented send mail on check.
	* kmacctlocal.cpp (processNewMail): Added message box
	warning if mail folder was not found.

	* kmmainwin.cpp Added editing of message in outbox folder.
	* kmfolderdlg.cpp Removed out of index warning
	

1998-07-23  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Added message status "Read". This status is set to
	messages which are loaded with check-mail that have
	status set to "R".
	
	These messages appear whith blue text, but without
	the green ball to the left, in the message list.

1998-07-22  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* main.cpp Applied session management patch.
 	* kmfolder.cpp Applied fseek patch for solaris

1998-07-03  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* PGP: fixed crash when no ~/.pgp/pubring.pgp is installed
	and signed message is selected.

1998-06-30  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.9)

	* PGP: removed dialog asking for pass phrase when only
	signed message was given, added missing asking for pass
	phrase when encrypted/signed message is sent.

	* Composer: fixed bug that showed busy pointer all the
	time with auto-append-signature set and no signature file
	given.

	* Composer: removed mSendImmediate which seems unused
	in the composer nowadays. Simplified code of slotSend,
	slotSendNow, and slotSendLater (to be easier consistent).

1998-06-29  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.8)

	* Config: writeConfig() was not called when windows
	got closed. Now it is.

1998-06-27  Markus Wuebben <markus@kde.org>

	* kmcomposewin.cpp (applyChanges): add false to applyChanges to
	avoid segfault on ALPHAs.

1998-06-24  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Pgp detection simplified and bugfixed.

	* Folder status messages for index creation and
	compacting folder reduced from every 100th to every 10th.

1998-06-23  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.7)

	* removed various unnecessary assert()s. and replaced them
	with if()s. Especially in functions that return void this
	is very helpfull and makes kmail more stable.

	* Checked return values with if()s for some functions to
	make sure that we run into to trouble with those problems.
	
1998-06-23  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.7)

	* Removed lots of old debug messages.

	* Composer: answering the confirmation is no longer
	ignored.

	* Finetuning: added missing pixmaps to makefile and
	repainted pixmap for queued and sent messages.

	* Composer: changed behaviour of email completion a bit.
	Now it is possible to add multiple recipients with comma
	separated and complete also those after the first one.
	Drawback: email addresses with comma in them are not
	handled properly currently.

	* Pop leave-on-server: due to the fact that we need another
	field in the pop settings dialog "download-all-msgs"
	the leave-on-server checkbox currently also toggles
	the download-all-msgs feature.
	So:  download-all-msgs = !leave-on-server

	* Folders are now marked red after download if they
	contain new or unread messages. As a feature, folders
 	that receive old messages are not marked.

	* Fixed problems in pop code downloading old messages
	also. The "download" dialog is a bit misleading because
	it should say now "checking message:" instead of
	"downloading message:" because old messages are counted
	here also.

1998-06-22  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.6)

	* fixed a whole bunch of stuff that made kmail segfault.

1998-06-21  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* small fix for quicker response in kmnewiostatus.cpp

	* "Delete folder" dialog now defaults to "No" (compliant to 
	KDE standards)

1998-06-20  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmsender.cpp (cleanup): Fixed the sendQueued problem.
	If only one message from the outbox couldnt get sent all
	following messages got deleted from the outbox. This is fixed now.
	

1998-06-19  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.6)

	* Folder: fixed broken locking on systems without
	flock(). Thanks to Werner Ertle <wer@christl.hl.siemens.de>
	who sent me the patch.

1998-06-18  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.5)

	* Deleting folders crashed kmail. Fixed.

	* Folder-compacting: added busy pointer and progress
	output in the status bar (idea from Mario).	

	* Reader: removed ':' from the characters that mark
	quoted text to catch smileys at the beginning of the
	line ;-)

	* Main window configuration (geometry, etc.) is now
	stored again.

	* Composer: changed completion key from Ctrl-. to Ctrl-T
	as kfile has.

1998-06-18  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Dialog for folder selection: Escape now closes dialog,
	remembers last folder, has a default pushbutton

1998-06-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.4)

	* Message-list: now the first unread/new message is
	displayed when opening a folder.

	* Message-status: now messages change status from
	"new" to "unread" when the user changes folder (and
	not when the folder is closed somewhere within KMail).

	* Reader: worked around problem of current HTML widget
	with long lines (without '\n')

1998-06-16  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.3)

	* Headers: Improved switching between folders to do
	less paints to avoid flickering where possible.

	* Warnings: changed warning messages of QPixmap and
	QPainter to debug messages to avoid lots of message
	boxes from broken KToolbar code when changing color 
	scheme.

	* Composer (email-address-completion)
	Changed email-address completion to be case insensitive.
	I think this is more useful in the general case.

	* Composer: fixed broken Tab handling. Replaced
	Tab-completion in the email-address header lines 
	(To, From, Cc, etc.) with Ctrl-. completion.

	* Filters: removed some debug statements that slowed
	down filtering a lot.

	* kmmsgbase.cpp: added isUnread() method.

	* Message-list: improved next/prev_unread_message methods.
	Improved code that ensures that current item is visible
	and added it to several places in the headers code.

1998-06-15  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* kmfilteraction.cpp (process): Removed patch for kmfilter
	action "Move" of 1998-06-14.
	Fixed bug in kmfilteraction "Move" action.

	* Fonts: reader- and composer-window now change
	their font when the settings are changed.

	* Shutdown: improved handling of window-close and
	KMail shutdown- and crash-handling.
	

1998-06-14  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmfilteraction.cpp (process): Applied patch for kmfilter
	actionmove.

1998-06-13  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.2)

	* key for next_unread_message and prev_unread_message added

1998-06-12  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Folder loading: moved status message in index
	creation to a more suitable place. Should be lots
	faster now.

	* Composer: Now path of last filedialog for attachments
	is stored.

	* Fonts: improved font settings. The HTML widget
	unfortunately only honors the font family. Added new
	functions (kfontutils.h) for easy font to/from string
	conversion.

1998-06-12  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.1)
	* new sort algorithm - quicksort instead of bubble-sort

1998-06-11  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.7.0)

	* Initial start now opens the settings dialog. Don't
	be alerted, this will happen once for everybody now ;-)

	* Fonts: implemented font setting for HTML widget,
	list of messages, and composer.

	* Drag&Drop: implemented drag&drop of messages to
	folders. Dropping into HTML widget crashes KMail. 
	Could be a bug of the HTML widget, however.

	* Move-message: improved folder selection dialog.

	* Message-list: now cleared properly when the current
	folder is deleted.

1998-06-11  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.9)

	* KMail now uses KFileDialog only!

1998-06-11  Mario Weilguni   <mweilguni@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.9)
	
	* "P" and "N" (next and previous mail) will cause the header
	list to be scrolled if the new item is not visible

	* fixed some code to prevent compiler warning

	* panner position is now (again) restored
	
1998-06-07  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.8)

	* Folders: changed message about index-recreation
	to debug from warning.

	* Message/Headers: Email addresses like <joe@home.org>
	(with the <> around the address) no longer lead to
	an empty field in the message list.

	* Headers: Removed extra space in header line(s).

	* Headers: Empty Subject moved From and Date one column
	left. Fixed (hopefully).

	* Composer: Send again did not decode quoted-printable
	sent messages. Fixed.

	* PGP: KMail did not ask for mantra upon first reading of
	an encrypted message. Applied patch, from Michael Vogel 
	<icarus@hades.pop-celle.de>, which hopefully works :-)

1998-05-13  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.7)

	* Filters: Bugfix: when deleting a folder that was the target
	of a filter the next get-mails crashed.

	* Filter Dialog: Deleting filter rules did not work. Fixed.

1998-05-09  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* kmsettings.cpp (KMAccountSettings):
	Fixed "Delete mail from server". The row was too low.
	* kmmainwin.cpp
	Added a single account mail check option.

1998-04-29  Markus Wuebben  <markus@kde.org>

	* Reader: Fixed the url parsing which made kmail 
	loop.

1998-04-28  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.6)

	* Folders: Emptying of the trash folder resulted in an infinite 
	loop. Fixed now.

1998-04-04  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (Kde Beta-4)

	* Filters: Removed warning dialog. Filters are working ok for
	me for several weeks now.

	* Folders: After I finally also deleted lots of important messages
	by mistake I now changed the behaviour of Folder->Empty to
	move the messages into trash instead of deleting them ;-)
	This made the "Are you sure" dialog now obsolete, IMO.

1998-03-31  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org> (KMail-0.6.5)

	* Folders: fixed bug introduced on 1998-03-26: open failed on
	folders where lock() returned an error.

1998-03-28  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Headers: when opening a folder the contents was not automatically
	sorted, now is.

	* Pop: new messages retrieved from pop accounts were not
	marked new. Now fixed.

1998-03-26  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Folders: when opening and locking a folder there were
	cases (in fact most of the time) when the folder seemed
	to be not locked but was. Now this is handled better.

1998-03-24  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.4)

	* Message: decoding of quoted-printable RFC1522 strings
	was broken for strings that started with a decoded character.

1998-03-18  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Reader: improved detection of urls and email addresses
	to ignore special characters at the end, e.g. "." or ")".

	* Messagelist: finally fixed sorting of messages. Also
	implemented ascending/descending/none sorting (use multiple
	clicks on the column headers to switch). Sorting order "none"
	is what was IMO missing for the trash folder :-)

1998-03-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.3)

	* Composer: in menu view, when 'all headers' view is 
	activated, then the individual header line menu entries are 
	disabled now.

	* Folders: changed creation of folders to -rw-------
	instead of the default -rw-r--r--. Same for the initial
	creation of ~/Mail.

	* Attachments: temporary files (when viewing attachments)
	are now also created with permissions -rw-------.
	
1998-03-15  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.2)

	* Startup: added option -check which does mail checking
	upon startup. Also options that start with a '-' but which
	are unknown are now skipped.

1998-03-09  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.1)

	* Reader: '_' was not considered part of a smart-detected email
	address (auto detection of @).

	* Reader: attachments of type message/rfc822 are now shown
	in an external reader window if open or view from the attachment
	popup menu is chosen.

	* Composer: finally got insertion of tabs into message
	working.

(many changes are missing here, sorry)
	
1998-02-14  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>

	* Startup: when recovering dead letters the auto signature was 
	appended twice. Fixed now.

	* Composer: fixed broken inserting of files.

	* kFileToString(): fixed handling of files with zero length.

Initial version: 0.5.7
