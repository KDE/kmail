	* Reader: improved detection of urls and email addresses
	to ignore special characters at the end, e.g. "." or ")".

	* Messagelist: finally fixed sorting of messages. Also
	implemented ascending/descending/none sorting (use multiple
	clicks on the column headers to switch). Sorting order "none"
	is what was IMO missing for the trash folder :-)

1998-03-17  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.3)

	* Composer: in menu view, when 'all headers' view is 
	activated, then the individual header line menu entries are 
	disabled now.

	* Folders: changed creation of folders to -rw-------
	instead of the default -rw-r--r--. Same for the initial
	creation of ~/Mail.

	* Attachments: temporary files (when viewing attachments)
	are now also created with permissions -rw-------.

	* Startup: added option -check which does mail checking
	upon startup. Also options that start with a '-' but which
	are unknown are now skipped.

1998-03-09  Stefan Taferner  <taferner@kde.org>  (KMail-0.6.1)

	* Reader: '_' was not considered part of a smart-detected email
	address (auto detection of @).

	* Reader: attachments of type message/rfc822 are now shown
	in an external reader window if open or view from the attachment
	popup menu is chosen.

	* Composer: finally got insertion of tabs into message
	working.

(many changes are missing here, sorry)

	* Startup: when recovering dead letters the auto signature was 
	appended twice. Fixed now.

	* Composer: fixed broken inserting of files.

	* kFileToString(): fixed handling of files with zero length.

Initial version: 0.5.7
